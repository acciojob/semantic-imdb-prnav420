		<a>On keeping his energy up
As actors, we have to work for 6-8 months at a stretch, and we become a team in the process. We might not stay in touch with each other after the movie, so we have to have a good time in the amount of time that we are together. Everyone needs to be in good spirits and enjoy what they do
On choosing scripts
I look forward to working with more people and learning newer things. The role and the team play a big factor when I choose a new script to work on.
On being nervous with every new film
Each time a film starts, itâ€™s a new project that I undertake, and when I am done with it, it feels like I am writing a major exam, so the pressure is always there.</a>
